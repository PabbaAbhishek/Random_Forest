The dataset ***Samplesuperstore_ml*** is used for the model and the code in jupyter notebook is the machine learning code used.
The dataset contains all the data related to a superstore in US. Profit and sales fields from the original dataset is tweaked to get better results and a new field called **Profit per sale** is replaced with profit field. Using the regression model, the profit per sale for different rows is predicted.
